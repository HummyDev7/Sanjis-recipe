      <ol class="steps-instruction">
        <li>Soak clams in salt water “of the same saltiness as the sea” for 2-3 hours, while covered with aluminum foil (or something to create a dark environment) to allow sand to be washed out.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice onion, cut the garlic in half lengthwise, remove any sprouts, and smash with the flat side of a kitchen knife. Coarsely chop Italian parsley.</li>
        <li>Put clams, onion, garlic and white wine in a covered frying pan and heat. When clams open, add white pepper and butter. Finally, stir in the heavy cream (A). Sprinkle with parsley after plating. The remaining sauce can be added to rice and eaten like risotto.</li>
